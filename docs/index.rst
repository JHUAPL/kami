Kami is agent-based modeling modern C++.  The objectives in writing
Kami are that it be lightweight, memory-efficient, and fast.  It
should be possible to develop a simple working model in under one
hour of C++ development time.  Accordingly, the platform is modeled
extensively on the `Mesa
<https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html>`_ library in
Python, which itself was inspired by the `MASON
<https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/>`_ library in Java.
